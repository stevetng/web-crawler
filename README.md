# Web Crawler

I wanted to learn how Google created a large enough DB of all URLs to then apply a Search algorithm over/how Search is optimized or done in different ways.

This program essentially shows how to perform web crawling over a specified URL to then create a graph of URLs on that site.

## Things to improve
1. Time it takes to crawl -- how do I do these functions in parallel?
2. Improving the actual visual of the graph
